# Style Guide

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pivotalexperimental/style-guide.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotalexperimental/style-guide) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/pivotalexperimental/style-guide.png)](https://gemnasium.com/pivotalexperimental/style-guide) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/pivotalexperimental/style-guide)

Style Guide was born out of a need to quickly audit the CSS applied to
visual elements and iterate on them in a controlled environment.  It is
implemented as a Rails engine in order to stay close to the application being
styled.

When used with [guard-livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload),
Style Guide automatically reloads itself when you make changes to the CSS,
Javascript or HTML in your site.


## Usage

First, require the StyleGuide gem in `application.rb`:

    require "style_guide"


Then, append a directory of partials in `application.rb`:

    config.style_guide.partial_paths << Rails.root.join("app/views/styles")


Next, mount the StyleGuide application in `routes.rb`:

    mount StyleGuide::Engine => "/style-guide" unless Rails.env.production?


Finally, add `Rack::LiveReload` to `environments/development.rb`:

    config.middleware.insert_before(::Rack::Lock, ::Rack::LiveReload)


## Enhancing Your Experience

Running [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) is highly recommended:

    $ guard init
    INFO - livereload guard added to Guardfile, feel free to edit it
    $ guard
    INFO - LiveReload is waiting for a browser to connect.

Using [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to manage the startup of
both your Rails app and Guard is an excellent idea.

First, turn off the Guard interactor so that it doesn't try to block output.
Add this line to the top of your `Guardfile`:

    interactor :off

Then add the following lines to `Procfile`, located in the root of your app:

    web: bundle exec rails s
    guard: bundle exec guard


## Best Practices

* Do not attempt to do layout in the Style Guide.  Attempting to make it lay
  out your pages will lead you down the road of madness.

* The canonical installation of Style Guide pulls in all of the
  directories under `app/views/style_guide`, like so:

        config.style_guide.partial_paths << Rails.root.join("app/views/style_guide/*")

* From here, the Style Guide is broken down into sections,
  like "Buttons", "Forms" and "Typography".

* You should only use static content in the partials you render
  to the Style Guide.
